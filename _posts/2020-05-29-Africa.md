Since its inception in 2008 Airbnb has a steady growth of the rentals that are listed in its website. Chicago has been one of the highest nuber of listings in the United States. This mean we have more homes/apt being rented out per square km. For this exercise i will be exploring Chicago listings sourced from Inside Airbnb and create different visualisations that will help understand what is available and how price has an impact on rental.
